TODO
 ☐ complete repo names - forget, show, use
 ☐ complete repo/file/directory names for copy command
 ☐ support some pip switches
   candidates: -r requirements.txt, --pre, --no-use-wheel
 ☐ setup_as_pypi command
    replaces repo type pypi, PyPIRepo
 ☐ setup_as_piplocal command
    replaces repo type piplocal, PipLocalRepo
 ☐ rename use command to make_pip_use
   or write_pip_conf_for?
 ☐ command serve to serve a repo with pypi-server(?)
   using per repo parameters:
     serve_username
     serve_password
     serve_interface
     serve_port
   like this:
   set repo serve_username=testuser
 ☐ support copying all package versions
   it is hard to do with dependencies, maybe per-package?

FIXME
 ☐ robustness: 'use repo', where repo does not have attributes set causes exception
 ☐ file created in place of directory when directory does not exists for file repos
