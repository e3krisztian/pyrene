TODO
 ☐ command 'set_defaults repo' - sets all valid attributes to some sensible value
   ☐ set user's login name as username
   ☐ generate password for serving directories
 ☐ support some pip switches when copying packages
   candidates: -r requirements.txt, --pre, --no-use-wheel
 ☐ support copying all package versions - ???
   it is hard to do with dependencies, maybe per-package?
 ☐ Repo.upload_packages -> Repo.upload_all_from(directory)
 ☐ command 'clean repo' - remove all extra attributes

FIXME
 ☐ robustness: do not allow 'write_pip_conf_for repo' to write file, when repo is not valid
 ☐ robustness: check user supplied repo names and give human feedback instead of exception
 ☐ remove order restriction from copy
    after we have a repo any package spec containing a / is treated as a local file
    all others are handled with pip
