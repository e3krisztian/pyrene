TODO
 ☐ resilience/autohealing:
   ✔ reload .pyrene file before operations - to immediately apply changes made in another Pyrene instance @done (14-04-17 00:42)
   ☐ setting repo type sets type based attributes to defaults (e.g. generates random password)
 ☐ support some pip switches
   candidates: -r requirements.txt, --pre, --no-use-wheel
 ☐ support copying all package versions
   it is hard to do with dependencies, maybe per-package?

FIXME
 ☐ robustness: 'use repo', where repo does not have attributes set causes exception
 ☐ file created in place of directory when directory does not exists for file repos
 ☐ robustness: check user supplied repo names and give human feedback instead of exception
 ☐ remove order restriction from copy
    after we have a repo any package spec containing a / is treated as a local file
    all others are handled with pip
