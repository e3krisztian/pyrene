TODO
 ☐ command 'set_defaults repo' - sets all valid attributes to some sensible value
   ☐ set user's login name as username
   ☐ generate password for serving directories
 ☐ command 'unset repo attribute' - remove attribute
   ✔ refactor: rename {key,parameter} to attribute @done (14-04-22 15:32)
 ☐ command 'clean repo' - remove all junk attributes
 ☐ support some pip switches when copying packages
   candidates: -r requirements.txt, --pre, --no-use-wheel
 ☐ support copying all package versions - ???
   it is hard to do with dependencies, maybe per-package?

FIXME
 ☐ robustness: do not allow 'write_pip_conf_for repo' to write file, when repo is not valid
 ☐ file created in place of directory when directory does not exists for file repos
 ☐ robustness: check user supplied repo names and give human feedback instead of exception
 ☐ remove order restriction from copy
    after we have a repo any package spec containing a / is treated as a local file
    all others are handled with pip
